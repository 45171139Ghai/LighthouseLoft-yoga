        <p>I am grateful for a job that adds passion to my heart, peace to my soul & where it's always an
          honour to hold space each I guide my tribe. I come from a trauma senssitive, hatha backround & my current teaching is 
          from a functional perspective, balancing strength with ease.
        </p>

        <p>Yoga is much more than achieving the perfect pose. Rather, it's made up of those a-ha moments where you practice the pause, feel your body,
          link with the breath or quiet th mind. More importantly, it's slowing down, tuning inward & finding that joy & peace that comes from within. It's always there
           but it may have been silenced by all those noise. This connection then allows to take the yoga off your mat, into your life & live in harmony & balance.
           And this, my friend, is true yoga!
        </p>

        <p>I think of Lighthouse Loft as a cozy patchwork quilt with threads of all my favourite yoga experiences. 
          My teaching style reflects my trainings & the experiences along my personal yoga journey. 
          I have been fortunate to train  & practice with many highly skilled yoga teachers.  
          I take pride in the classes I plan & the special touches that make this studio unique. 
          Through intention, meditation, breath work & poses, my goal is to have students leave each class feeling calm, refreshed & inspired. 
          My classes are relaxing, casual & fun delivered with music, demonstration, hands on assist & individual attention. I aim to live a yoga inspired lifestyle and lead my classes in a way that reflects that choice.  
          I hope this studio is a source of peace, inspiration & transformation for others.

          <p>I'ave always been described as a free spirit, tree hugger, hippie kinda person & I love it!
            My soul finds solace near water or in the forest & my inner child is totally blissed out with the moon & nature's gifts such as seashells,
            rocks & feathers to name a few. For me, it's the simple things that soothe my soul - big belly laughs, my fur & furless babies. Morning
            coffee, sunsrises, sunsets or moments spent with the loved ones. I love oils, crystals, cards, journals, smudging, meditation & mantras & I
            like to sprinkle these throughout my practice. I completed both my 200 hr <u>YTT & Warriors Trauma Training in 2015. </u>I am currently finishing
            my <u>300 hr YYT </u>that is scheduled to finish in November 2020. I feel the union of my social work background, reiki training as well as my yoga skill
            set is guiding me towards a healing path nourishing the body as well as the mind, heart & soul. Who knows what the universe has in store for me 
            but I am  open to receive & grow with curiosity, presence & passion while soaring with a free spirit.
